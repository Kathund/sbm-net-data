very simple guide to adding mods

  {
    "id": "mod-name", # this is the mod id, its no different than the name, except for the fact there should not be any spaces in it (this is not displayed to the user)#*
    "name": "mod name", # this is the mod name, it is shown on the website to the user #
    "discord": "https://discord.gg/epic-skyblock-mod", # discord link, this field is not required, so if there is no discord link this line should be deleted #
    "developers": "epic_mod_develoepr", # developer name(s) #
    "paid": false, # true = paid, false = not paid #
    "price": "1.00", # if paid is false, this line should be deleted, otherwise if paid is true, a cost should be included #
    "icon": "https://imgur.com/image91984239204.png", # if the mod developer has a github or some online profile, right click on their avatar / profile picture and click 'copy image address' and put it here; Or if the mod has a logo, use that image instead # 
    "website": "https://google.com", # website link, this field is not required, so if there is no website link this line should be deleted #
    "github": "https://github.com/", # github link, this field is not required, so if there is no github link this line should be deleted #
    "tags": ["popular", "fps"] # what describes this mod? if skyblock put 'skyblock', and 1 other tag that describes it the most (ex. dungeon mod put 'dungeons'). If it is a cheat mod the "cheats" tag is required
  }

  after editing this insert it into the right json file and make sure there are commas after the curly bracket '}', look at the files to see how it is supposed to look like
